}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{name of the GILDAS file including path to be opened}

\item{header}{a data frame with one row for each scan requested.}
}

list of length n, where n is the number of scans.

\description{
Given a filename and a data frame 'header', open the file and scan it
for single dish spectra or continuum scans.
For each row in the header frame, return the correspi√≥nding scan as a list
with a head, freq and data section. For continuum scans, the frequency
vector will simply be a running index. All the individual lists are
combined into one major list, which is returned.
