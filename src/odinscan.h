    This structure plays a central role for the processing
    of Odin SMR spectral line data. It is in this format that data will
    be stored and handled by the processing computer at Onsala Space 
    Observatory. Many of the routines described further down in this
    documentation require a pointer to such a structure as one of their 
    input and/or output parameters.

    History:
   
    Version 0.1: 
    Original version sent out to members of Odin data working group for
    discussion on March 19, 1997.

    Version 0.2:
    Slightly modified version presented at Odin data working group
    meeting in Toulouse, June 5, 1997.

    Version 0.3:
    Incorporated changes suggested at Odin data working group meeting
    in Toulouse, June 5, 1997 and rearranged and grouped structure
    members following suggestions made by Alain Lecacheux.

    Version 0.4:
    Added source name and topic.
    Added positions of Sun and Moon.
    Added flags indicating if sky beams point at Sun, Moon, Earth 
    or avoidance zone.
    Based on agreements from Odin meetings on April 20, 1998 at CTH
    and on May 15, 1998 at SSC.

    Version 0.5:
    Added sideband IF frequency which has maximum suppression.
    Added solar zenith angle (requested by Eric Le Flochmoen, France).
    Based on e-mail received from Frank Merino, MISU.

    Version 0.6:
    Rearrangements of a few structure members in order to optimize for
    conversion to FITS binary tables.

    Version 0.7:
    Major changes concerning new and removed structure members, following
    Odin scheduling meeting at SSC, Stockholm on March 9, 1999.
    Units of angles changed from radian to degrees.

    Version 0.8:
    Added structure member EffTime, following calibration meeting at MISU.
    Removed structure member Bandwidth. Added union to support tangent point
    in aeronomy mode and map position in astronomy mode.

    Version 0.9:
    Added new spectra types: SK1, SK2, DRK for sky beam 1, sky beam 2 
    and AOS dark spectrum, respectively. 
    Edited comments for frontend types.

    Version 1.0:
    Added backend FBA, after decision at OST 35 to store filter bank data
    as 3 channel spectrometer and abandoning extra file formats for FBA data.
    Added flag SATURNMB and replaced flags EAC1, EAC2 and EAOS by ECALMIRROR
    and ESIGLEVEL.
    Replaced member Vhel by Vgeo, following suggestion by Nicolas Biver.
    Added doc++ style comments.

    Version 1.1
    Added spectrum type SPE for calibrated spectra. Added bit definition
    WBANDADJUST which will be set in correlator spectra which show 
    stair-caseing. Redefined bit definition for ICOMMISSION.

    Version 1.2
    Replaced structure member 'Trec' by 'SBpath', after discussion during
    a meeting of the Odin SMR aeronomy data retrieval group at Onsala, May 
    21-23, 2001.
    Added definitions of constants for storing the aeronomy mode in member
    'Topic'.

    Version 1.3
    Added spectrum type SSB for sideband ratio, after SMR-RG meeting in 
    Bordeaux. Also added type AVE for averaged spectra, mainly meant for
    astronomy.

    Version 1.4
    Corrected definitions of SkyBeamHit related constants (EARTH1, ...)
    to correspond to individual bits.

    Version 1.5
    Introduced new way of describing IntMode for AC1 and AC2. These new
    mode designations are characterised by setting bit ADC_SEQ in header
    variable IntMode. Bits AC_SPLIT and AC_UPPER are replaced by ADC_SPLIT
    and ADC_UPPER. All IntMode dependent code is supposed to handle both
    old and new modes and should check bit ADC_SEQ before processing.

    Version 1.6
    Replaced header variable FreqThrow by SodaVersion, in order to store
    software version used during attitude reconstruction.

/**@name Constants

   The following macros should be used whenever possible rather than 
   integer constants, to make sure that program code stays portable 
   from one version to another. This means you should use code like
   \begin{verbatim}
   if (scan->Backend == AOS) ...
   \end{verbatim}
   rather than
   \begin{verbatim}
   if (scan->Backend ==   3) ...
   \end{verbatim}
   to test for the backend information in an OdinScan structure.
